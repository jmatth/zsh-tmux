This is a fork of the tmux plugin from the
[oh-my-zsh framework](http://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh),
mirrored here for easier use with plugins such as
[antigen](http://github.com/zsh-users/antigen)
and
[zilsh](https://github.com/zilsh/zilsh).

If you suspect that this mirror is out of date, please open an issue and I will
merge any changes from the upstream repository.
